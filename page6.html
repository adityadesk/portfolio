                        the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of agricultural production. Their
                        action is attributable to physiological and biochemical modifications due to the
                        activities of signaling molecules – signaling peptides and select amino acids.
                        The production process must be able to standardize composition regarding the
                        content of <strong> bioactive molecules </strong> through controls on raw material and
                        controlled
                        processes. <strong> Enzymatic hydrolysis allows better control and better quality of the
                            resulting product</strong>.</p>
